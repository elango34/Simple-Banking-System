<p>This is a simple banking system program, It uses sqlite database to store card information.
The card number is generated by Luhn algorithm and the pin 
is generated randomly. You can create as many account you want, and it is stored in database. </p>

<p>You can log in into any account, and it provides some functionality such as :</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1. Balance
2. Add income
3. Do transfer
4. Close account
5. Log out
0. Exit</code></pre>

<p>If the user asks for <code class="java">Balance</code>, it read the balance of the account from the database and output it into the console.</p>

<p><code class="java">Add income</code> item should allows you to deposit money to the account.</p>

<p><code class="java">Do transfer</code> item should allows you to transferring money to another account. The following errors may appear :</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the user tries to transfer more money than he/she has, it outputs: <code class="java">Not enough money!</code></li>
	<li>If the user tries to transfer money to the same account, it outputs the following message: <code class="java">You can't transfer money to the same account!</code></li>
	<li>If the receiver's card number doesn’t pass the Luhn algorithm, it output: <code class="java">Probably you made a mistake in the card number. Please try again!</code></li>
	<li>If the receiver's card number doesn’t exist, it outputs: <code class="java">Such a card does not exist.</code></li>
	
</ul>

<p>If the user chooses the <code class="java">Close an account</code> item, it delete that account from the database.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not a part of the input.</p>


<p>The database file name should be passed to the program using <code class="java">-fileName</code> command line argument, for example, <code class="java">-fileName db.s3db</code>.</p>

<p>Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts, if the database already exists it didn't create new one.</p>

All data is stored in sqlite database.
